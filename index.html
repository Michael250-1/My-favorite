        Coding is a list of step-by-step instructions that get computers to do what you want them to do. Coding makes it possible for us to create computer software, games, apps and websites. Coders, or programmers, are people who write the programmes behind everything we see and do on a computer.It's helpful because you can learn not only how to make websites or games, you can learn much more, for example math.While having fun!coding is not hard to learn, but it's also not easy, either, and how difficult a time one has with learning to code will vary across a number of factors. The point is, learning to code isn't impossible; or, it's not as impossible as it might seem when it comes to getting your kids involved. So don't give up!
